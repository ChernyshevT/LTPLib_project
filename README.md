Detailed description will be given soon.

## \_ltplib: <ins>L</ins>ow <ins>T</ins>emperature <ins>P</ins>lasma <ins>Lib</ins>rary
A middle-layer framework that provides simple python-interface for PiC+MCC simulations (Particles in Cells + Monte-Carlo Collisions).
The library offers a range of functions and primitives to facilitate a wide class of low-temperature plasma problems.
By creating a more abstract and user-friendly interface, \_ltplib aims to enable researchers and engineers to formulate and solve simple PiC+MCC problems in a flexible manner using python.
```python
import _ltplib as ltp
help(ltp)
```
